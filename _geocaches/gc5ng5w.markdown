**(Dutch: Langs de Limes #3: Pons)**

Do you know about the [Limes][wiki limes]? That's how we call the frontier of the ancient Roman Empire (actually, "Limes" is just Latin for "frontier").
Since this frontier followed the river Rhine, it also crossed the town of Bodegraven. To be honest, at that time Bodegraven wasn't that large so there was not much for the Limes to cross; there was, however, a [small Roman fortress near the current town centre][wiki bodegraven].

In 2014, the municipality of Bodegraven-Reeuwijk decided to build a park at the "frontier" between residential, industrial and rural areas.  It's quite a nice location, especially during spring and summer when the park is full of wildflowers. This geocache is located in this so-called Limespark. As the name states, the cache is situated near / on / below / ... a bridge ("Pons"). Most people think it's a tricky one, so you might need the hint. You can find a translated version of the hint at the bottom of this page. 

**Please note:** You should not remove the caps from the cross beams as indicated in the picture below. Some people tried to find the cache in those cross beams, unintentionally demolishing parts of the bridge.
