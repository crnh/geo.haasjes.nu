title: Hi and welcome!

This is the online geocaching archive of team geohaasjes. It is not a blog and it will probably (hopefully) never become a blog.
We just want to share some extra stuff related to our own caches, mainly english descriptions. And, if you like to do _online_ geocaching,
there are also some hidden hints on this site. With the right knowledge it won't be hard to find them.

Happy caching!
